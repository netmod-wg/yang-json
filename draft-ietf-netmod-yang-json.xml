    <section anchor="sec.introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The NETCONF protocol <xref target="RFC6241"/> uses XML <xref
      target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/> for encoding data in its Content
      Layer. Other management protocols might want to use other
      encodings while still benefiting from using YANG <xref
      target="RFC6020"/> as the data modeling language.</t>
      <t>For example, the RESTCONF protocol <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf"/> supports two encodings: XML
      (media type "application/yang.data+xml") and JSON (media type
      "application/yang.data+json).</t>
      <t>The specification of the YANG data modelling language <xref
      target="RFC6020"/> defines only XML encoding for data instances,
      i.e. contents of configuration datasores, state data, RFC input
      and output parameters, and event notifications. The aim of this
      document is to define rules for encoding the same data as
      JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) text <xref
      target="RFC7159"/>.</t>
      <t>In order to achieve maximum interoperability while allowing
      implementations to use any existing JSON parser, the JSON
      encoding rules follow, as much as possible, the constraints of
      the I-JSON restricted profile <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-json-i-json"/>. Section <xref
      target="sec.i-json"/> discusses I-JSON conformance in more
      detail.</t>

                                       Instance Data">
      <t>Instance data validation as defined in <xref
      target="RFC6020"/> is only applicable to XML-encoded data. For
      one, semantic constraints in "must" statements are expressed
      using XPath 1.0 <xref target="W3C.REC-xpath-19991116"/>, which
      can be properly interpreted only in the XML context.</t>
      <t>This document along with the corresponding "XML Mapping
      Rules" sections from <xref target="RFC6020"/> also define an
      implicit schema-driven mapping of JSON-encoded instances to
      XML-encoded instances (and vice versa). This mapping is mostly
      straightforward. In cases where doubts could arise, this
      document gives explicit instructions for mapping JSON-encoded
      instances to XML.</t>
      <t>In order to validate a JSON instance document, it MUST first be
      mapped, at least conceptually, to the corresponding XML instance
      document. By definition, the JSON document is then valid if and
      only if the XML document is valid according to the rules stated in
      <xref target="RFC6020"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="sec.names-ns" title="Names and Namespaces">
      <t>Instances of YANG data nodes (leafs, containers, leaf-lists,
      lists and anyxml nodes) are always encoded as members of JSON a
      object, i.e., as name/value pairs. This section defines how the
      name part is formed, and the following sections deal with the
      value part.</t>
      <t>The member name is the same as the identifier of the
      corresponding YANG data node. Every such name belongs to a
      namespace which is uniquely identified by the YANG module where
      the corresponding data node is defined. If the data node is
      defined in a submodule, then the namespace is determined by the
      main module to which the submodule belongs.</t>
      <t>In some situations specified below, the namespace of a member
      name has to be explicitly specified. In such a case, the module
      name SHALL be used as a prefix to the (local) member name. Both
      parts of the member name SHALL be separated with a colon
      character (":"). In other words, the namespace-qualified name
      will have the following form:</t>

      <figure anchor="fig.ns-enc"
              title="Encoding a namespace identifier with a local name.">
        <artwork>
    <![CDATA[<module name>:<local name>]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>

      <t>Names with namespace identifiers in the form shown in <xref
      target="fig.ns-enc"/> MUST be used for all top-level YANG data
      nodes, and also for all nodes whose parent node belongs to a
      different namespace. Otherwise, names with namespace identifiers
      MUST NOT be used.</t>
      <t>For example, consider the following YANG module:
      <figure>
        &foomod.yang;
      </figure></t>
      <t>If the data model consists only of this module, then the
      following is a valid JSON-encoded configuration:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
    <![CDATA[{
      "foomod:top": {
        "foo": 54
      }
    }]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>
      <t>Note that the top-level container instance contains the
      namespace identifier (module name) but the "foo" leaf doesn't
      because it is defined in the same module as its parent container.</t>
      <t>Now, assume the container "top" is augmented from another
      module, "barmod":
      <figure>
        &barmod.yang;
      </figure>
      </t>
      <t>A valid JSON-encoded configuration containing both leafs may
      then look like this:
      <figure>
        <artwork>
    <![CDATA[{
      "foomod:top": {
        "foo": 54,
        "barmod:bar": true
      }
    }]]>
        </artwork>
      </figure>
      </t>
      <t>The name of the "bar" leaf must be prefixed with the
      namespace identifier because its parent is defined in a
      different module, hence it belongs to another namespace.</t>
      <t>Explicit namespace identifiers are sometimes needed when
      encoding values of the "identityref" and "instances-identifier"
      types. The same form as shown in <xref target="fig.ns-enc"/> is
      then used as well. See Sections <xref format="counter"
      target="sec.idref"/> and <xref format="counter"
      target="sec.i-i"/> for details.</t>

             title="Encoding of YANG Data Node Instances">

      <t>Every complete JSON instance document, such as a
      configuration datastore content, is an object. Its members are
      instances of all top-level data nodes defined by the YANG data
      model.</t>
      <t>Character encoding MUST be UTF-8.</t>
      <t>Any data node instance is encoded as a name/value pair where
      the name is formed from the data node identifier using the rules
      of <xref target="sec.names-ns"/>. The value depends on the
      category of the data node as explained in the following
      sections.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.leaf"
               title='The "leaf" Data Node'>

        <t>A leaf instance is encoded as a name/value pair where the
        value can be a string, number, literal "true" or "false" or
        the special array "[null]", depending on the type of the leaf
        (see <xref target="sec.datatypes"/> for the type encoding
        rules).</t>

        <t>Example: For the leaf node definition

    <![CDATA[leaf foo {
      type uint8;

        <t>A leaf-list is encoded as a name/array pair, and the array
        elements are values whose type depends on the datatype of the
        leaf-list (see <xref target="sec.datatypes"/>).</t>

        <t>A list instance is encoded as a name/array pair, and the
        array elements are JSON objects.</t>
        <t>Unlike the XML encoding, where list keys are required to
        precede any other siblings, in the order specified by the data
        model, the order of members within a JSON-encode list entry is
        arbitrary because JSON objects are fundamentally unordered
        collections of members.</t>

        "null".</t>
        <t>This document defines no mapping between the contents of

        because anyxml contents are not subject to YANG-based
        validation (see sec. 7.10 in <xref target="RFC6020"/>).</t>

             title="The Mapping of YANG Datatypes to JSON Values">

      <t>The type of the JSON value in an instance of the leaf and leaf-list
      data node depend on the datatype of that data node as specified
      in the following subsections.</t>

      <section anchor="sec.numtypes" title="Numeric Datatypes">
        <t>A value of the "int8", "int16", "int32", "uint8", "uint16"

        representation of that numeric value as specified in sections
        9.2.1 and 9.3.1 of <xref target="RFC6020"/>.</t>
        <t>For example, if the type of leaf "foo" in <xref

      <section anchor="sec.enum" title='The "enumeration" Type'>
        <t>An "enumeration" value is mapped in the same way as a

        statements in YANG. See sec. 9.6 in <xref
        target="RFC6020"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.bits" title='The "bits" Type'>
        <t>A "bits" value is mapped to a JSON string identical to the
        lexical representation of this value in XML, i.e.,
        space-separated names representing the individual bit values
        that are set. See sec. 9.7 in <xref target="RFC6020"/>.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.binary" title='The "binary" Type'>
        <t>A "binary" value is mapped to a JSON string identical to

      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.idref" title='The "identityref" Type'>
        <t>An "identityref" value is mapped to a string representing the

        as shown in <xref target="fig.ns-enc"/> if it is different
        from the namespace of the leaf node containing the identityref
        value, and MAY be expressed otherwise.</t>
        <t>For example, consider the following schematic module:</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    <![CDATA[module exmod {
      ...
      import ietf-interfaces {

      leaf type {
        type identityref {
          base "if:interface-type";
        }
      }
    }]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>A valid instance of the "type" leaf is then encoded as
        follows:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    <![CDATA["type": "iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd"]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        </t>
        <t>Node that the namespace identifier "iana-if-type" must be
        present in this case because the "ethernetCsmacd" identity is
        not defined in the same module as the "type" leaf.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.empty" title='The "empty" Type'>
        <t>An "empty" value is mapped to "[null]", i.e., an array with
        the "null" value being its only element.</t>
        <t>This encoding was chosen instead of using simply "null" in
        order to facilitate the use of empty leafs in common
        programming languages. When used in a boolean context, the
        "[null]" value, unlike "null", evaluates to "true".</t>

        <t>Example: For the leaf definition
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    <![CDATA[leaf foo {
      type empty;
    }]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        a valid instance is
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    <![CDATA["foo": [null]]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        </t>

      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.union" title='The "union" Type'>
        <t>A value of the "union" type is encoded as the value of any
        of the member types.</t>
        <t>Unlike XML, JSON conveys part of the type information
        already in the encoding. When validating a value of the
        "union" type, this information MUST also be taken into account.</t>
        <t>For example, consider the following YANG definition:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    <![CDATA[leaf bar {
      type union {
        type uint16;
        type string;
      }
    }]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        In RESTCONF <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf"/>, it is
        then fully acceptable to set the value of "bar" in the
        following way when using the "application/yang.data+xml" media
        type:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    <![CDATA[<bar>13.5</bar>]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        because the value may be interpreted as a string, i.e., the
        second member type of the union. When using the
        "application/yang.data+json" media type, however, this is an error:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
    <![CDATA["bar": 13.5]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        In this case, the JSON encoding indicates the value is
        supposed to be a number rather than string.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="sec.i-i" title='The "instance-identifier" Type'>
        <t>An "instance-identifier" value is encoded as a string that
        is analogical to the lexical representation in XML encoding,
        see sec. 9.13.3 in <xref target="RFC6020"/>. The only
        difference is that XML namespace prefixes used for qualifying
        node names in the instance-identifier value are replaced by
        the corresponding module names according to the rules of <xref
        target="sec.names-ns"/>.</t>
        <t>Conversely, when translating such a value from JSON to XML,
        the namespace identifier (YANG module name) in each component of
        the instance-identifier MUST be replaced by the XML
        namespace prefix that is associated with namespace URI
        reference of the module.</t>
        <t>For example, assume "ex" is the prefix associated with the
        namespace URI that is defined in the "example" module. Then
        the XML-encoded instance-identifier
        <figure>
          <artwork>
            /ex:system/ex:user[ex:name='fred']
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        corresponds to the following JSON-encoded instance-identifier:
        <figure>
          <artwork>
            /example:system/example:user[example:name='fred']

    <section anchor="sec.i-json" title="I-JSON Compliance">
      <t>I-JSON <xref target="I-D.ietf-json-i-json"/> is a restricted
      profile of JSON that guarantees maximum interoperability for
      protocols that use JSON in their messages, no matter what JSON
      encoders/decoders are used in protocol implementations. The
      encoding defined in this document therefore observes the I-JSON
      requirements and recommendations as closely as possible.</t>
      <t>In particular, the following properties are guaranteed:
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>Character encoding is UTF-8.</t>
	<t>Member names within the same JSON object are always unique.</t>
	<t>The order of JSON object members is never relied upon.</t>
	<t>Numbers of any type supported by YANG can be exchanged
	reliably. See <xref target="sec.numtypes"/> for details.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
      <t>The only two cases where JSON instance document encoded
      according to this document may deviate from I-JSON were dictated
      by the need to be able to encode the same instance data in JSON
      as in XML. They are:
      <list style="symbols">
	<t>Leaf values encoded as strings may contain code points
	identifying Noncharacters that belong to the XML character set
	(see sec. 2.2 in <xref target="W3C.REC-xml-20081126"/>).</t>
	<t>Values of the "binary" type are encoded with the base64
	encoding scheme (see sec. 9.8.2 in <xref target="RFC6020"/>
	whereas I-JSON recommends base64url instead. However, the use
	of base64 should never cause interoperability problems because
	these values never appear in an URL.</t>
      </list>
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="sec.cons" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>This document defines an alternative encoding for data
      modeled in the YANG data modeling language. As such, it doesn't
      contribute any new security issues beyond those discussed in
      sec. 15 of <xref target="RFC6020"/>.</t>
      <t>JSON is rather different from XML, and JSON parsers may thus
      suffer from other types of vulnerabilities than their XML
      counterparts. To minimize these security risks, it is important
      that client and server software supporting JSON encoding behaves
      as required in sec. 3 of <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-json-i-json"/>. That is, any received JSON data
      that violate any of I-JSON strict constraints MUST NOT be
      trusted nor acted upon. Violations due to the presence of
      Unicode Noncharacters in the data exceptions (see <xref
      target="sec-i-json"/>) SHOULD be carefuly examined.</t>
